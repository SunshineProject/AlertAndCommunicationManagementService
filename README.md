**Energy awareness for buildings**: It is the mathematical model which is the base of the suggestion service provided by SUSNHINE. The model is designed with the purpose to exploit the information provided by smart meters and weather forecast in order to characterize the energy behavior of the building in according with the local climatic conditions. The inputs of the model are the physical characteristics of the building, the weather forecasts, the energy consumption of the past, the comfort temperature and the period of the day in which this temperature should be ensured.

**Energy awareness for shelter**: It is the mathematical model to describe the energy behavior of the shelters involved on scenario 2 within the Trentino Pilot. Shelters are special technical buildings where the servers for TLC are hosted; these must have a controlled internal temperature so they consume a lot of energy especially during the hot season. The main requirements for SUNSHINE is to provide an accurate energy consumption model based on the weather forecasts, this will be the base for identify anomalies or to distribute in an efficiency way the load between the different shelters.
